## Introduction

The Web Header Formatter app is a simple tool that allows you to easily convert a string of web headers into a dictionary that can be used in your Python code. This can be useful if you're working with web APIs or making HTTP requests in Python, as it allows you to easily format your headers in the correct format.

The app is built using the Streamlit framework, which makes it easy to deploy your Python code as a web app. The app is deployed online, so you can access it from anywhere with an internet connection.

To use the app, simply enter your web headers as a string in the input field and press the "Format" button. The app will then convert your headers into a dictionary and display the result in the output field.
